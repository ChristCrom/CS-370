# CS-370

During this course, I was given basic code to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm for a pathfinding problem, where a pirate navigates a maze to find treasure. The provided code included setting up the environment, starting the neural network, and defining the reward system. I wrote additional code to make the agent learn better, like adjusting settings, adding the experience replay mechanism, and improving the neural network's design. These changes helped the agent explore and learn the maze more effectively.

Connecting this to the field of computer science, it's clear that computer scientists are essential in creating algorithms and technologies that impact society. They solve problems methodically, combining theory and practical skills to create new solutions. In this project, I broke down the pathfinding problem, applied reinforcement learning, and refined the solution through testing and analysis. As a computer scientist, it's also important to be ethical. This means making sure algorithms are fair, clear, and do not harm users or organizations. Responsible AI development involves considering the effects of technology, aiming for accuracy, and keeping user trust and privacy in mind.
